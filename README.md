**Introduction**
    Classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset is a classic example in the field of machine learning and neural networks. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit. In this example, I'll guide you through building a simple neural network for digit classification using Python and a popular deep learning library, TensorFlow.

 **Objective**
    Certainly! Let's structure the information for a typical project README file:

### MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Networks

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a neural network model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

#### Evaluation Criteria
The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy in correctly classifying digits in the test set. The accuracy metric will be used to measure the performance of the model.

#### Solution Approach
The solution approach involves building a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture includes a flattening layer, a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation, a dropout layer for regularization, and a dense output layer with softmax activation.

#### How To Use
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using the command `pip install tensorflow`.

2. **Run the Code:**
   Execute the provided Python script or Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model.

3. **Adjust Hyperparameters:**
   Experiment with different hyperparameter values, layers, or architectures to improve the model's performance.
